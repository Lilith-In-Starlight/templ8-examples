# Core Renaming Example

Most text editing software nowadays supports syntax highlighting. It often relies on the presence of an extension to the file, which conflicts with the fact that templ8's basehtml file does not have an extension. This can be solved with Core Renaming, a feature which lets you rename most of the base files of templ8, except for d8y (which is used to tell templ8 what files have been renamed).

Check out the `d8y` file and the fact that the base template file is called `base.html` (with a dot). Also check out the `templ8 help core-renaming` command.
